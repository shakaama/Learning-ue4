# Learning-ue4
My journey in learning UE4.
8/2/2019 started unreal engine 4 tutorial on youtube. although I had 3 projects already in ue4, this was the first one that actually would commence the learning process. the other contained cute stuff, organzed from the market, that was free, that I liked, in certain genres I was interested in.
DAY 1 using blueprint only in ue4 made a new character, 3rd person, world with premade assets. created jump, crouch, magic, health and stamina. and then I made sprint. that was 4 videos by itself. then i started a skill tree UI overlay.
DAY 2 started looking at level design, but the tutorial guy talked A LOT.
DAY 3 will continue with level design, but have to go to doctor for some super duper major surgery, on my toenail.
